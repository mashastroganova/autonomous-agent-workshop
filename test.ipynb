      "\n",
      "### Analysis:\n",
      "1. **Complaint History**:\n",
      "   - There have been ongoing complaints over the past 6 months.\n",
      "2. **Connection Status**:\n",
      "   - Your connection status is currently marked as \"Pending,\" indicating there might be pending fixes or installations.\n",
      "3. **Mass Outage**:\n",
      "   - There is a mass outage currently affecting Internet and Phone services in Munich, with an estimated resolution time of 1 day.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Detailed Resolution Steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mass Outage Confirmation**:\n",
      "   - The primary reason for your current issues is a mass outage in your area. This is affecting both Internet and Phone services.\n",
      "   - The outage is expected to be resolved within a day. We recommend waiting for the outage to be fixed and then checking your connection again.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pending Connection Status**:\n",
      "   - While awaiting the resolution of the mass outage, it's important to address the \"Pending\" status of your connection.\n",
      "   - This status might imply a pending installation or a fix that hasn't been completed. Ensure that there are no unresolved issues on your end, such as pending payments or scheduled maintenance appointments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps:\n",
      "1. **Wait for the Outage to Resolve**:\n",
      "   - Given the mass outage in Munich, wait until service is restored by the estimated resolution time provided (1 day).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check Connection Status Post-Outage**:\n",
      "   - Once the outage is resolved, check your connection status. If the status is still \"Pending,\" contact customer support to confirm if any additional steps are required to fully activate your service.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Monitor for Any Further Issues**:\n",
      "   - Even after the resolution of the mass outage and the change of your connection status to active, continue to monitor your connectivity. If any issues persist, report them immediately for a more targeted investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Assumptions:\n",
      "- Assuming your payments are up to date as the provided data did not indicate a payment issue.\n",
      "- Assuming that any pending installations or fixes are already scheduled and simply need completion.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have any further questions or need additional assistance after the outage is resolved, don't hesitate to get in touch with technical support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel free to reach out if you have any concerns or need further clarification.\n",
