    "2. __Onboarding buddy__: An agent onboarding the user, by answering questions based on the company's internal sources and guiding through mandatory assignments for better understanding ⭐\n",
    "3. __Memory manager__: An agent responsible for memory management of onboarding sessions, and memories/personal preferences of the user in the database. Thanks to the memory manager, the conversation can restart exactly where it was left off ⭐"
