      "At Contoso, we're all about collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity. We believe in working together to achieve great things and supporting each other along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Example\n",
      "Imagine this: You're working on a project and hit a roadblock. At Contoso, it's totally normal to reach out to colleagues from different departments for their insights. For instance, if you're unsure about a supplier's sustainability practices, you could ask someone from the Environmental Team for guidance. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also have regular team-building activities and company-wide events to help everyone stay connected and engaged, even if they're working remotely. Last quarter, we had an online escape room challenge that everyone loved!\n",

      "Contoso ensures all new hires get the required training for any systems they will be using. Here's how it typically works:\n",
      "- **Orientation**: We'll start with an orientation session that gives a high-level overview of how Ariba fits into our procurement processes.\n",
      "- **Hands-On Training**: You'll get practical, hands-on training sessions where you'll learn how to perform specific tasks within the Ariba system.\n",
      "- **Resource Materials**: We provide comprehensive resource materials, including guides and video tutorials, that you can refer to anytime.\n",
      "- **Ongoing Support**: Even after your initial training, you'll have access to support from our IT team and your colleagues. You can always ask questions if you run into any issues or need a refresher.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Setting Expectations\n",
      "We believe in setting clear and achievable performance goals. Right from the beginning, you'll work closely with your manager to understand your deliverables and how your performance will be assessed. This ensures you're always on the right track and know what's expected of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Regular Check-ins\n",
      "We have regular check-ins, often on a bi-weekly or monthly basis, where you can discuss your progress, any challenges you're facing, and adjustments to your goals if necessary. These check-ins are meant to be collaborative and supportive.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Feedback\n",
      "At Contoso, feedback is a two-way street. We encourage you to give feedback to your peers and managers constructively. Similarly, be prepared to receive feedback in a positive manner. The goal is to help everyone grow and improve continuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Example \n",
      "Let's say you’ve completed a procurement contract, and your manager provides feedback that you could optimize the negotiation process. This feedback isn't just about pointing out what's missing, but also about offering ways you can enhance your skills and perhaps suggesting additional resources or training.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you feeling comfortable with this so far? Any questions or need more details? 😊\n",
