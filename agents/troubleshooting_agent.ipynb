      "Based on the information gathered, here is the analysis of your issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Findings:\n",
      "1. **Customer Details**:\n",
      "    - You are identified as having a Premium tier internet service with a Satellite connection.\n",
      "    - Your connection status currently shows as \"Inactive\". \n",
      "    - Your service is associated with a specific product, a mobile plan, which seems unrelated to your internet service.\n",
      "    - There's a history of complaints related to the internet connection over the last three days.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Product Information**:\n",
      "    - Your product plan is primarily a mobile plan with 12GB high-speed data and other features like unlimited calls and SMS. \n",
      "    - It is important to note that this product might not be linked directly to your home internet service.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mass Outage Information**:\n",
      "    - The city of San Francisco is reported as \"healthy\" with no ongoing outages affecting your area. This means the issue is likely localized to your specific setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Account and Billing**:\n",
      "    - There is an ongoing issue related to billing where the payment method has failed and is in progress to be resolved. \n",
      "    - Your connection status might be inactive due to this unresolved billing issue. It appears there is an account-related technical problem that requires a reset.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Contact Billing and Support**:\n",
      "    - Reach out to your billing support (maggy.smith@telecommunications.com and john.adams@telecommunications.com) to expedite resolving your payment method issue.\n",
      "    - Ensure your billing information is updated and functional to restore service.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Restart Router**:\n",
      "    - Although your main issue seems to be billing-related, we can attempt to restart your router as a precaution to eliminate any potential minor technical hiccups. Would you like me to proceed with restarting your router?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps:\n",
      "- Please verify and update your billing information.\n",
      "- Confirm if you would like a router restart.\n",
      "- Monitor the connection once the billing issue is resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any more questions or require further assistance on any specific point? Let me know how you would like to proceed.\n",

You are identified as having a Premium tier internet service with a Satellite connection.\\n    - Your connection status currently shows as \"Inactive\". \\n    - Your service is associated with a specific product, a mobile plan, which seems unrelated to your internet service.\\n    - There\\'s a history of complaints related to the internet connection over the last three days.\\n\\n2. **Product Information**:\\n    - Your product plan is primarily a mobile plan with 12GB high-speed data and other features like unlimited calls and SMS. \\n    - It is important to note that this product might not be linked directly to your home internet service.\\n\\n3. **Mass Outage Information**:\\n    - The city of San Francisco is reported as \"healthy\" with no ongoing outages affecting your area. This means the issue is likely localized to your specific setup.\\n\\n4. **Account and Billing**:\\n    - There is an ongoing issue related to billing where the payment method has failed and is in progress to be resolved. \\n    - Your connection status might be inactive due to this unresolved billing issue. It appears there is an account-related technical problem that requires a reset.\\n\\n### Recommendations:\\n1. **Contact Billing and Support**:\\n    - Reach out to your billing support (maggy.smith@telecommunications.com and john.adams@telecommunications.com) to expedite resolving your payment method issue.\\n    - Ensure your billing information is updated and functional to restore service.\\n\\n2. **Restart Router**:\\n    - Although your main issue seems to be billing-related, we can attempt to restart your router as a precaution to eliminate any potential minor technical hiccups. Would you like me to proceed with restarting your router?\\n\\n### Next Steps:\\n- Please verify and update your billing information.\\n- Confirm if you would like a router restart.\\n- Monitor the connection once the billing issue is resolved.\\n\\nDo you have any more questions or require further assistance on any specific point?
