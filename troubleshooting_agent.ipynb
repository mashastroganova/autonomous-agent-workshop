      "1. **Customer Information:**\n",
      "   - **Name:** Sophia Taylor\n",
      "   - **Address:** 288 T Street, Munich\n",
      "   - **Service Tier:** Standard\n",
      "   - **Internet Connection Type:** Cable\n",
      "   - **Connection Status:** Pending\n",
      "   - **Complaint History:** Complaints in the last 6 months\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mass Outage Information:**\n",
      "   - There is a mass outage currently affecting Internet and Phone services in Munich.\n",
      "   - Estimated resolution time is 1 day.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step-by-Step Resolution\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Connection Status:**\n",
      "   - **Pending status:** This may indicate that there may be some administrative or technical steps yet to be completed. It could be related to a new service activation, ongoing maintenance, or issues related to account verification.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Mass Outage:**\n",
      "   - There is a known mass outage in your area which is currently affecting Internet services.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Wait for the Outage to be Resolved:**\n",
      "   - Given the current mass outage, the best immediate action is to wait for the outage to be resolved within the estimated timeframe of 1 day. This could very likely be the root cause of many service interruptions in your area, including your internet connection problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Confirm Connection Status Once Outage is Over:**\n",
      "   - If the issue persists after the outage is resolved, and your connection status remains \"Pending,\" it is necessary to contact customer support. Inform them about the status so they can expedite the activation or investigate if any further administrative actions are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Check for Pending Bills:**\n",
      "   - Although it doesn't appear to be related to your current issue, it's always good to make sure that there are no outstanding payments that might affect the connection activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Assumptions:\n",
      "- The mass outage is the primary cause of the issue.\n",
      "- The \"Pending\" status may relate to either an administrative hold or new service setup.\n",
      "- No current issues related to non-payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have any more specific details or need further assistance, please feel free to ask!\n",
