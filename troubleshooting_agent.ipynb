      "   - **Address:** 288 T Street, Munich\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Pending Connection Status:**\n",

      "2. **Contact Customer Support:**\n",
      "   - If your internet connection status remains \"Pending\" after the outage is resolved, contact customer support to check for any pending installation or service setup issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Monitor Outage Updates:**\n",
      "   - Keep an eye on any updates regarding the outage. Most service providers send notifications or provide updates on their website.\n",
